This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Security workflow (staging)

All development must happen in `staging`. Do not push direct production changes to `main`.

### Secret scanning

This repository includes local and CI secret scanning:

1. Install git hooks (one-time per clone):
```bash
npm run hooks:install
```

2. Scan current repository files:
```bash
npm run secrets:scan
```

3. Run the same scanner before commit (the pre-commit hook checks staged files automatically):
```bash
npm run secrets:scan:staged
```

### Secret handling policy

1. Never commit credentials, tokens, API keys, passwords, or private URLs.
2. Keep secrets only in environment managers (`.env.local`, Vercel env vars, Supabase secrets).
3. Commit only placeholders in templates (for example `tu_api_key`).
4. If a secret is exposed, rotate it immediately and remove it from Git history.

## Quality commands

```bash
# Product-surface lint (default)
npm run lint

# Same as lint, explicit
npm run lint:app

# Full repository lint (informative, broader and stricter)
npm run lint:repo

# Type safety validation
npm run typecheck

# Production build validation
npm run build
```

## CI pipeline (staging)

`staging` now runs `.github/workflows/ci-staging.yml` with:

1. `npm ci`
2. cache cleanup of `.next`
3. `npm run lint:app`
4. `npm run typecheck`
5. `npm run build`

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
